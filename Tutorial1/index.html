      The term “computer engineering” covers a range of intertwined IT disciplines. The three general branches of computer engineering are hardware, software, and network engineering.

There are many ways to define a computer engineer, and a common definition is an IT professional who has network, systems, and software engineering experience. Computer engineer is also used to describe someone who has a background in electrical engineering.

    <p align="Justify">
      Technically, mechanical engineering is the application of the principles and problem-solving techniques of engineering from design to manufacturing to the marketplace for any object. Mechanical engineers analyze their work using the principles of motion, energy, and force—ensuring that designs function safely, efficiently, and reliably, all at a competitive cost.

      Mechanical engineers make a difference.</p>
