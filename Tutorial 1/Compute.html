        <ol>
            <li><b>Communication Skills:</b> Computer engineers must work closely with other team members, including software engineers. They may also work with non-technical departments and employers when discussing project goals. An engineer must also clearly state design aspects and instructions to ensure the manufacturing process goes smoothly.</li>
            <li><b>Skills:</b> An engineer must test their design multiple times to achieve a desired result. These professionals need to locate local issues in a larger system by testing, recording data, and analyzing the results.</li>
            <li><b>Problem-solving Skills:</b> After analyzing flaws in the system, engineers need to find alternative ways of achieving the initial design goal or task. These employees may need to balance performance with the price or availability of resources while developing a project.</li>
            <li><b>Critical Thinking:</b> When testing and altering a product design, engineers need to account for other factors affected by each change. Creating a successful design may require engineers to develop new techniques or look for solutions outside their standard field.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="w3-container w3-red"><h2>Key Hard Skills For Computer Engineer</h2></div>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Microprocessors and Circuitry:</b> Computer engineers must master the study of microprocessors and circuitry since those components make up the foundation of computers. Engineers cannot create electronics without understanding how to generate electric currents and transfer information on a physical level.</li>
            <li><b>Quality Assurance and Testing:</b> Tech engineers rigorously test hardware designs and systems to ensure everything works correctly. A solid foundation in this skill allows engineers to prioritize major functions such as cybersecurity while finding workarounds for minor issues.</li>
            <li><b>Digital Signal Processing:</b> Computer engineers develop systems that allow data to be sent via wireless communications. Digital signals create the basis of modern data storage and the internet, including speech and video processing.</li>
            <li><b>Operating Systems:</b> A computer engineer needs extensive knowledge of major operating systems, like Windows, ReactOS, MacOS, and Linux, since the job often involves incorporating hardware with software.</li>
